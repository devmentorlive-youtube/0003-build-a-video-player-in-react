# Build a Video Player in ReactJS

## DevmentorLive #0003

So......

Your boss comes to you and they say, "Yeah.... it would be great if you could make us a video player. It should take a video url and it should fill the full width in mobile profile and landscape and also on Desktop. It will need to have a play/pause button, a volume control, a mute button, and a slider for the seek timeline. The viewer should be able to drag it and click anywhere to skip to that part."

And you say, "This is React, that's easy!"
